# Basic-College-FAQ-Chatbot-Using-LangChain-and-FAISS-No-API-
On Scale of Zero to Ten, i am posting 0th level project which is basic College FAQ Chatbot Using LangChain and FAISS (No API)
I will post 10 levels of Bots 

I have built an basic question-answering chatbot that can answer queries about college policies (like attendance rules) by extracting and searching real content from online pages, "without using any paid APIs like OpenAI" By adding more website links which contains college information we can make it better.
I have installed langchain,FAISS,Sentence Trasformers, and tools for web scraping i have used RecursiveURLLoader from specific Quora pages related to the college.
spliting the content into smaller chunks and then converting into vector embeddings locally, after converting into vectors stored the data into vector base(data base)so that user's can access information for the asked questions in no time instead of going through websites
